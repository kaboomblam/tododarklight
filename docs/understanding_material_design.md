### Accent colors
The **primary key** color is used to derive roles for key components across the UI.

The **secondary key** color is used for less prominent components in the UI such as filter chips, while expanding the opportunity for color expression.

The **tertiary key** color is used to derive the roles of contrasting accents that can be used to balance primary and secondary colors or bring heightened attention to an element.

### Neutral colors
The **neutral key** color is used to derive the roles of surface and background, as well as high emphasis text and icons.

The **neutral variant** key color is used to derive medium emphasis text and icons, surface variants, and component outlines. 

### Additional colors

- Error colors - semantic color for the error
- Custom colors - give teams more control and customization alongside the variability of a dynamic color environment
