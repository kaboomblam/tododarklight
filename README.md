# Learning goals

Hopefully, I will practice these technologies:

- [x] [Material 3 Design](https://m3.material.io/styles/color/overview) - color system

  - [ ] [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - routing
- [ ] [Vite JS](https://vitejs.dev/) - build tool

> This is my first Demo project of 2023 ðŸ¥³ðŸŽ‰. I'm using it to learn and practice new technologies.

## Why these technologies
Mostly because I find these particular technologies interesting and I hope to learn something new.
